# ML-and-Deep-Learning-Fundamentals
Implemented clustering and a handwritten digit recognition model to gain hands-on experience in this project.

1. RGB_to_HSV.ipynb contains the Python code to convert BRG images to RGB and RGB images to HSV using the CV2 library. It is just a basic tool used in clustering and image recognition.
2. Python code for Fuzzy C-means clustering is added in the Clustering folder. The ref_image.png file contains a image of various articles. The depth_array.txt file contains an array of the distances of objects from camera. I have also added a basic report for clustering.
3. The Python code for building a deep learning to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. For this model, the PyTorch framework for development, the ReLU activation function, the log softmax function in the output layer, and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as an optimiser is used. The test_images folder contains some images used to test the model on images other than the MNIST dataset.
